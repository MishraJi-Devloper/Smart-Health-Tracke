# Smart Health Tracker

A health risk prediction web application using Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP animations, and Git for version control.

## Project Overview

The **Smart Health Tracker** is a web-based health tracker that helps users predict their health risk based on parameters like age, BMI, and activity level. It uses a machine learning model for health risk prediction, providing users with valuable insights. The frontend is designed with modern animations using GSAP and Three.js, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user experience.

## Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, Three.js
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Dependencies**:
  - Flask
  - GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
  - Three.js (for 3D animations)

## Features:
- Predict health risks based on input parameters (Age, BMI, Activity Level)
- Modern and responsive user interface
- Interactive animations using GSAP and Three.js
- Light/Dark mode toggle for user preferences
- Seasonal background effects (e.g., snow in winter, sun in summer)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not Installing Dependencies Correctly**:
   Ensure you install all dependencies before running the app using the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Not Organizing Files Properly**:
   Keep your project structure clean by separating the frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and backend (Flask) files.

3. **Not Handling Errors or Edge Cases**:
   Always check if user inputs are valid and handle any errors properly, especially when working with forms and API calls.

4. **Not Committing Changes Regularly**:
   Use Git to commit your changes regularly. It helps you keep track of your progress and prevent losing work.

5. **Not Testing Before Deployment**:
   Test the website locally before deploying to ensure everything functions as expected.

6. **Ignoring CORS Issues (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:
   If making AJAX calls between frontend and backend, make sure CORS is handled correctly by using `flask-cors`.
